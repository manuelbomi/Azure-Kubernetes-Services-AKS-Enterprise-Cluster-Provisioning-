# Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Enterprise Cluster Provisioning

## Introduction  

#### This repository provides a step-by-step guide to provisioning an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI. 

#### The focus is on enterprise-grade applications, where automation, repeatability, and cost-efficiency are critical.

#### While the Azure Portal is often the first entry point for new users, enterprise deployments require a CLI-driven, scriptable, and automated workflows such as shown in figure 1 below, to ensure consistency across environments. 

#### Figure 1: Azure CLI based AKS Cluster Provisioning Workflow

#### This tutorial documents the full journey of an enterprise grade AKS cluster provisioning: from portal provisioning errors ðŸ Š to using Azure CLI successfully ðŸ Š to validating the cluster with kubectl ðŸ Š and finally connecting the cluster to Lens for observability. 

#### The cluster was designed to provide for multiple pods that can handle an app ( https://app.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/ ) and its metric monitoring pods ( https://grafana.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/login   ;   https://prometheus.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/query  ). 

#### The full step-by-step details regarding how the AKS cluster provisioned with the set of instructions provided here was used to create an enterprise grade app and its monitoring pods are provided at: https://github.com/manuelbomi/End-to-End-LLM-App-Deployment-on-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS-with-Streamlit-Prometheus-Grafana

## Why Enterprise Applications Need CLI-Based AKS Provisioning 

* Automation: Enterprise systems require repeatable infrastructure setup. CLI enables scripting and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

* Flexibility: Some VM SKUs are unavailable in certain regions. CLI gives full control to query supported VM sizes dynamically.

* Scalability: Easy to adjust node pools, VM sizes, and regions with CLI scripts.

* Integration: CLI commands can be embedded into enterprise workflows, DevOps pipelines, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

---

## Azure Portal Limitation   

#### When creating an AKS cluster in the Azure Portal, you may run into validation errors.

#### Example:

* Attempting to provision a cluster in East US region with Standard_B2ms nodes failed because the VM size was not available in that region.

* This is a common limitation with the portal:

* It doesnâ€™t automatically filter by available SKUs in your subscription + region.

* Enterprise users need a more reliable method: Azure CLI.

#### Example of how this particular issue always occur in practice is shown by the infograph below:

## Azure CLI Workflow  
#### To avoid dashboard issues such as shown above, and to easily provision for enterrpise grade AKS cluster, it is good to use Azure CLI. 

#### Follow the steps below to use Azure CLI to create AKS clusters that can support enterprise grade Kubernetes clusters:

#### 1. List Supported VM Sizes in Your Region

* This command lists all VM SKUs available in your subscription + region, filtering only those with â‰¥ 2 vCPUs:

---
```ruby
kubectl create namespace ingress-nginx
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update
helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
--namespace ingress-nginx \
--set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer

```
---

##### Explanation : 

--location eastus2: checks VM availability in the eastus2 region.

--resource-type virtualMachines: limits results to VM SKUs.

--query: filters to VMs with â‰¥ 2 CPUs (suitable for AKS).

--output table: presents results in a clean table format.

From this list, you can pick the cheapest available SKU (commonly Standard_B2s or Standard_B2ms).

--- 

#### 2. Create the AKS Cluster
##### Option A â€“ Dynamically pick the cheapest available SKU:

---
```ruby
az aks create \
  --resource-group llm_enterprise-rg \
  --name llm-enterprise \
  --location eastus2 \
  --node-vm-size $(az vm list-skus \
      --location eastus2 \
      --resource-type virtualMachines \
      --output table \
      | grep -E 'Standard_B2s|Standard_B2ms|Standard_D2s_v3' \
      | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}') \
  --node-count 1 \
  --generate-ssh-keys

```
---

##### Option B â€“ Manually specify a VM SKU (if known available):
---
```ruby
az aks create \
  --resource-group llm_enterprise-rg \
  --name llm-enterprise \
  --location eastus2 \
  --node-vm-size Standard_B2s \
  --node-count 1 \
  --generate-ssh-keys

```
---

##### Explanation   :

--resource-group: resource group to contain your AKS cluster.

--name: cluster name (llm-enterprise).

--node-vm-size: VM SKU (either dynamically chosen or explicitly set).

--node-count: number of nodes (start with 1 for cost efficiency).

--generate-ssh-keys: auto-generates SSH keys for VM access.

---

#### 3. Connect kubectl to Your Cluster

---
```ruby
az aks get-credentials \
  --resource-group llm_enterprise-rg \
  --name llm-enterprise

```
---

##### Explanation   :
* This pulls cluster credentials and configures your local kubectl to talk to the AKS cluster.

---

#### 4. Verify Cluster Connectivity
---
```ruby
kubectl get nodes

```
---

##### You should see your node(s) listed and in Ready state.

#### You may choose to observe the created AKS cluster from your local Windows machine

##### Check AKS cluster config from local machine

##### This example shows that two nodes: systempool and userpool are correctly created

---

##### To get all pods running inside our cluster kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/041d7929-4787-4ce7-9609-fd7ce2c876b8" />

---

##### Use the o -wide argument to obtain details of all teh pods

## Visualize Cluster in Lens  

#### For enterprise observability, you can connect the cluster to Lens:

* Install Lens

* Import your kubeconfig (retrieved from az aks get-credentials).

* Lens will display your AKS cluster resources in a graphical dashboard.

* This is particularly useful for enterprise teams managing multiple clusters.

##### Use Lens GUI to get access to you AKS cluster

## Workflow Summary

* Tried Azure Portal â†’ ran into SKU availability errors.

* Switched to Azure CLI â†’ listed available VM SKUs in region.

* Created AKS cluster with cheapest suitable SKU.

* Connected AKS cluster to kubectl for CLI management.
  
* Use local Windows machine to observe created AKS cluster

* Connected AKS cluster to Lens for enterprise observability.


## Enterprise Readiness  

#### This repository demonstrates a CLI-first approach to AKS cluster creation â€” critical for:

* DevOps automation

* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Cost-aware VM SKU selection

* Scalable enterprise workloads

* Future extensions could include:

  -- Automating deployments with Helm charts.

  -- Integrating Ingress + TLS for production traffic.

  -- Enabling monitoring and logging with Azure Monitor.

  -- Expanding to multi-node pools for enterprise-grade workloads.
