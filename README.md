# Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) Enterprise Cluster Provisioning

## Introduction  ðŸ“Œ 

#### This repository provides a step-by-step guide to provisioning an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI. 

#### The focus is on enterprise-grade applications, where automation, repeatability, and cost-efficiency are critical.

#### While the Azure Portal is often the first entry point for new users, enterprise deployments require a CLI-driven, scriptable, and automated workflows such as shown in figure 1 below, to ensure consistency across environments.

#### This tutorial documents the full journey of an enterprise grade AKS cluster provisioning: from portal provisioning errors ðŸ Š to using Azure CLI successfully ðŸ Š to validating the cluster with kubectl ðŸ Š and finally connecting the cluster to Lens for observability. 

#### The cluster was designed to provide for multiple pods that can handle an app ( https://app.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/ ) and its metric monitoring pods ( https://grafana.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/login   ;   https://prometheus.emmanueloyekanluprojects.com/query  ). 

#### The full step-by-step details regarding how the AKS cluster provisioned with the set of instructions provided here was used to create an enterprise grade app and its monitoring pods are provided at: https://github.com/manuelbomi/End-to-End-LLM-App-Deployment-on-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS-with-Streamlit-Prometheus-Grafana
